Description: imageHTS is an R package dedicated to the analysis of
        high-throughput microscopy-based screens. The package provides
        a modular and extensible framework to segment cells, extract
        quantitative cell features, predict cell types and browse
        screen data through web interfaces. Designed to operate in
        distributed environments, imageHTS provides a standardized
        access to remote data and facilitates the dissemination of
        high-throughput microscopy-based datasets.
